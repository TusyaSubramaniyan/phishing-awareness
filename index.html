  <h1>Types of Phishing Attacks (with Real Examples)</h1>

  <p>
    Phishing is one of the oldest and most common tricks cybercriminals use to fool people online. The goal is usually to steal personal data like passwords, OTPs, or bank info. Below are some common phishing techniques I researched along with real-world examples.
  </p>

  <div class="attack-type">
    <h2>1. Email Phishing</h2>
    <p>This is the classic one—someone pretends to be your bank, Netflix, or even your college and sends an email asking you to "click this link" to fix an issue or confirm your account.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> I once received a fake Gmail security alert saying my account was accessed from Russia. It looked real, but the link was fishy!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="attack-type">
    <h2>2. Spear Phishing</h2>
    <p>This one is more targeted. Instead of sending the same email to thousands, attackers customize it for one person or company.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A school admin in Chennai got an email from someone pretending to be the principal asking for student records. It was a trap.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="attack-type">
    <h2>3. Whaling</h2>
    <p>Whaling targets big fish—CEOs, directors, or anyone with authority. These emails are super professional and hard to detect.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a real case, a finance manager transferred ₹25 lakh to a fake vendor after getting a spoofed email from their 'CEO'.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="attack-type">
    <h2>4. Smishing</h2>
    <p>SMS + Phishing = Smishing. These are fake texts that try to trick you into clicking shady links or sharing info.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> “Your SBI account will be blocked. Click here to verify.” These are everywhere now.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="attack-type">
    <h2>5. Vishing</h2>
    <p>Voice phishing. The attacker calls you pretending to be from your bank, tech support, or even the police.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A friend got a call from ‘Amazon’ asking for an OTP to cancel an order she never placed.</p>
  </div>
